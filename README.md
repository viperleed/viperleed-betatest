- tleedm: for LEED-IV calculations. This is usually only packed for UNIX.

Please, use the "Issues" tab to open new issues should you encounter any bug, for new feature requests, as well as for comments on usability of the package.

You can also open an Issue in case you would like executables packed for different operating systems.
