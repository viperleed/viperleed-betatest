# ViPErLEED-betatest
The most recent executables for the ViPErLEED package. The complete source code of the ViPErLEED package will be made available to the general public as soon as possible (i.e., after submission of relevant manuscripts).

The contents of this repository are solely intended for internal use, and should not be distributed without explicit consent. Please contact riva@iap.tuwien.ac.at in advance if you wish to redistribute any of the content. We are happy to officially include new users as beta testers.

You find the most recent release in the [Releases](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed-betatest/releases) section on the right. Each release is accompanied by a Change Log with the most recent changes, and contains:
- **doc**: archive with the most recent documentation. Accessed from the `ViPErLEED_doc` link or by opening the `./doc/index` file. Note: Files are displayed correctly under Linux, and by Firefox under Windows, but may not be displayed correctly in other browsers under Windows.
- **GUI**: archive containing the graphical user interface (Windows >= 7, UNIX) and some example input files. Offers a LEED pattern preview, and exports a `PatternFile.csv` required by the spot tracker (see [`pattern file examples`](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed-betatest/tree/main/pattern%20file%20examples) for some examples). The input file for your current structure is also automatically generated by tleedm upon initialization from a `POSCAR` file.
- **imagej_plugins**: spot tracker and curve editor. Platform independent. Used for extracting IV curves from a LEED movie and for post-processing the intensities (averaging symmetry-equivalent beams and smoothing). Produces the `EXPBEAMS.csv` file that is needed for running LEED-IV calculations. If you do not have ImageJ, you can downaload it [here](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html). Please keep your ImageJ version up to date using the `Help>Update ImageJ...` menu (requires write access to the ImageJ
directory). Requirements on the ImageJ version can be found in the [Release](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed-betatest/releases) description. If the `Help>Update ImageJ...` does not work, you can download the most recent ij.jar file [here](http://wsr.imagej.net/download/daily-build/), and replace the one in your ImageJ install path. Place the contents of this archive into your `%ImageJ install path%/plugins/` folder and restart ImageJ. You will then find the plugins in the `Plugins>ViPErLEED` Menu. Use `Plugins>ViPErLEED>Open Aida LEED video` (for Aida video only), `File>Open`/`File>Import>...` for other video types, or `File>Import>Image Sequence...`/`File>Import>Raw...` for a collection of frames.
- **tleedm**: for LEED-IV calculations. This is usually only packed for UNIX. Performs LEED-IV calculations based on the TensErLEED package from input files. This creates quite a lot of files, so it is recommended to have an additional job script (see, e.g., [`example-job.sh`](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed-betatest/blob/main/example-job.sh)) moving the input files and tleedm executable into a work folder and executing it there. When exiting, tleedm will create a `manifest` file, which is a list of files and folders that should be copied back. Note that tleedm requires access to a fortran compiler (preferrably ifort) on the workstation. See documentation on the FORTRAN_COMPILE parameter for details. 
- **bookkeper**: for keeping track of your calculations in a file `history.info`. This is usually only packed for UNIX. See [`example-job.sh`](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed-betatest/blob/main/example-job.sh) for an example of bookkeeper usage. Execute bookkeeper with flag `-c` for continuation jobs, i.e. to overwrite the `POSCAR` and `VIBROCC` input files in the main folder with the latest `POSCAR_OUT` and `VIBROCC_OUT` from the `OUT` folder.
- **tensorleed**: archive of the core TensErLEED [[Comput. Phys. Commun. **134**, 392 (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0010-4655(00)00209-5)], and related code. EEASiSSS [[Phys. Rev. B **76**, 195441 (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.76.195441)] is distributed with kind permission from [John Rundgren](https://www.kth.se/profile/jru?l=en).
